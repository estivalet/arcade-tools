3DO M2, 3DO, 199?

The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (often called simply 3DO) is a video game console originally produced by Panasonic in 1993. Further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by Sanyo and Goldstar. The consoles were manufactured according to specifications created by The 3DO Company, and were originally designed by Dave Needle and RJ Mical of New Technology Group. The system was conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. Despite a highly-promoted launch (including being named Time magazine's "1994 Product of the Year") and a host of cutting-edge technologies, the 3DO's high price (US$699.95 at launch), limited third-party developer support, and an over-saturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to competitors Sega and Nintendo. This console was released in North America on October 4, 1993, and in Japan on March 20, 1994. In 2009, video game website IGN chose the 3DO as its 22nd greatest video game console of all time, out of its list of 25. Price drops announced in February 1996 were perceived in the industry to be an effort to improve market penetration before the release of the promised successor of 3DO, the M2. Heavy promotional efforts on the YTV variety show It's Alive and a stream of hinted product expandability supported that idea; however, the M2 project was eventually scrapped altogether (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DO_Interactive_Multiplayer).

Alice with MCX-128, Matra & Hachette, 2011

The Matra & Hachette Ordinateur Alice is a home computer sold in France beginning in 1983. It was a clone of the TRS-80 MC-10, produced through a collaboration between Matra and Hachette in France and Tandy Corporation in the United States. The Alice is distinguished by its bright red casing. Functionally, it is equivalent to the MC-10, with a Peritel SCART connector replacing the RF modulator for video output. Unlike its progenitor, the Alice became a popular computer in its home country, aided by its presence in schools as part of the countrys Informatique pour tous "Information technology for everyone" programme. The original model had 4 kB of RAM and used a Motorola 6847 video display generator chip, as used in the Dragon 32 and Acorn Atom among others (source: https://amp.blog.buy-us.net/164110/1/matra-alice.html).

Apple IIgs (ROM03 late prototype?), Apple Computer, 1989

The Apple IIGS, the fifth and most powerful model in the Apple II series of personal computers produced by Apple Computer. The "GS" in the name stands for Graphics and Sound, referring to its enhanced graphics and sound capabilities, both of which greatly surpassed previous models of the line. At the time of its release, while it featured graphics comparable to other advanced home computers of the era (even more advanced than the black and white Macintosh, apart from a lower vertical resolution), it was most notable for its then state-of-the-art sound and music synthesis which surpassed all other personal computers at the time. The machine was a radical departure from any previous Apple II, with its true 16-bit architecture, increased processing speed, direct access to megabytes of RAM, wavetable music synthesizer, graphical user interface, and mouse. While still maintaining full backwards compatibility with earlier Apple II models, it blended the Apple II and aspects of Macintosh technology into one. Keeping with Apple's "Apple II Forever" slogan of the time, the IIgs set forth a promising future and evolutionary advancement of the Apple II line, but Apple paid it relatively little attention as the company increasingly focused on the Macintosh platform. The Apple IIgs was the first computer produced by Apple to use a color graphical user interface, as well as the "Platinum" (light grey) color scheme and the Apple Desktop Bus interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices. It was also the first personal computer to come with a built-in "wavetable" sample-based synthesizer chip, utilizing technology from Ensoniq. The machine outsold all other Apple products, including the Macintosh, during its first year in production.

Attache (boot rev F), Otrona, 1982

The American company's first major product, the Otrona Attach?, came out in April 1982 and folded up to the size of a fat briefcase painted off-white with orange trim. When set up for use, the carrying handle swung under the chassis to prop it up for easier viewing. A keyboard could be removed from one end, revealing a small 5 inch monochrome CRT and two 360Kb "half-height" 5.25 inch floppy disk drives. The system featured a Zilog Z80 microprocessor at running 4 MHz, used the CP/M version 2 operating system with 64K of RAM and optionally, a modified version of IBM's DOS operating system. The RAM can be upgraded to 640Kb and had several programs in ROM. It contained a single speaker for sound output (which could be set to give audible feedback when keys were pressed) and two RS422 serial ports for communication. It also supported monochrome bit-mapped graphics, and introduced the concept of desk accessory programs, such as a calendar. calculator and auto-run timer that could be run without closing a user application. This innovative application set, known as Valet, predated the appearance of similar functionality in the 1984 Macintosh (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otrona).

BBC Micro Model B w/1770 FDC, Acorn, 1985

The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, was a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the BBC Computer Literacy Project, operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability and the quality of its operating system. Acorn introduced the Model B+ in mid-1985, increasing the total RAM to 64 KB and including floppy-disk support as standard, but this had modest market effect. The extra RAM in the Model B+ BBC Micro was assigned as two blocks, a block of 20 KB dedicated solely for screen display (so-called "Shadow" RAM) and a block of 12 KB of 'special' Sideways RAM. The B+128 came with an additional 64 KB (4 × 16 KB "Sideways" RAM banks) to give a total RAM of 128 KB. The new B+ was incapable of operating some original BBC B programs and games, such as, for example, the very popular Castle Quest. A particular problem was the replacement of the Intel 8271 floppy disk controller with the Western Digital 1770 – not only was the new controller mapped to different addresses, it was fundamentally incompatible and the 8271 emulators that existed were necessarily imperfect for all but basic operation. A piece of software that used copy protection techniques involving direct access to the controller, simply would not operate on the new system. Acorn attempted to alleviate this, starting with version 2.20 of the 1770 DFS, via an 8271-backward- compatible Ctrl+Z+Break option (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro#Export_models).

ColecoVision (Thick Characters), Coleco, 1982

The ColecoVision is Coleco Industries' second generation home video game console which was released in August 1982. The ColecoVision offered near-arcade-quality graphics and gaming style, and the means to expand the system's basic hardware. Released with a catalog of 12 launch titles, with an additional ten games announced for 1982, approximately 145 titles in total were published as ROM cartridges for the system between 1982 and 1984. River West Brands currently owns the ColecoVision brand name. In 2009, IGN named the ColecoVision their 12th best video game console out of their list of 25, citing "its incredible accuracy in bringing current-generation arcade hits home (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision

D-50 (Ver. 1.xx), Roland, 1987

The Roland D-50 is a synthesizer produced by Roland and released in April 1987. Its features include Linear Arithmetic synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. The external Roland PG-1000 (1987-1990) programmer could also be attached to the D-50 for more complex manipulation of its sounds. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550 (1987-1990), with almost 450 user-adjustable parameters. The D-50's capabilities could be modified through the addition of third-party products by Musitronics, most notably the M-EX which made the D-50 multitimbral (the D-50 was bi-timbral), as well as a chip that improved the D-50's response to incoming MIDI commands and a system for burning custom PCM cards with user samples for playback in the D-50 (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_D-50).

Katana Set 5 Prototype, Sega, 1998

As early as 1995, reports surfaced that Sega would collaborate with Lockheed Martin, The 3DO Company, Matsushita, or Alliance Semiconductor to create a new graphics processing unit, which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit "Saturn 2" or an add-on peripheral. Development of the Dreamcast was wholly unrelated to this rumored project. In light of the Saturn's poor market performance, Irimajiri decided to start looking outside of the company's internal hardware development division to create a new console.[32] In 1997, Irimajiri enlisted the services of IBM's Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an 11-man team to work on a secret hardware project in the United States, which was referred to as "Blackbelt". Accounts vary on how an internal team led by Hideki Sato also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega of Japan tasked both teams,[33] while another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiri's choice to begin development externally and chose to have his hardware team begin development. Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 graphics processor, manufactured by NEC, in the production of their mainboard. Initially known as "Whitebelt", this project was later codenamed "Dural", after the metallic female fighter from Sega's Virtua Fighter series.
Yamamoto's group opted to use 3dfx Voodoo 2 and Voodoo Banshee graphics processors alongside a Motorola PowerPC 603e central processing unit (CPU), but Sega management later asked them to also use the SH-4 chip. Both processors have been described as "off the shelf" components. In 1997, 3dfx began its IPO, and as a result of legal obligations unveiled its contracts with Sega, including the development of the new console. This angered Sega of Japan executives, who eventually decided to use the Dural chipset and cut ties with 3dfx. According to former Sega of America vice president of communications and former NEC brand manager Charles Bellfield, presentations of games using the NEC solution showcased the performance and low cost delivered by the SH-4 and PowerVR architecture. He further stated that "Sega's relationship with NEC, a Japanese company, probably made a difference [in Sega's decision to adopt the Japanese team's design] too". Stolar, on the other hand, "felt the U.S. version, the 3Dfx version, should have been used. Japan wanted the Japanese version, and Japan won". As a result, 3dfx filed a lawsuit against both Sega and NEC claiming breach of contract, which would eventually be settled out of court. The choice to use the PowerVR architecture concerned Electronic Arts (EA), a longtime developer for Sega's consoles. EA had invested in 3dfx but was unfamiliar with the selected architecture, which was reportedly less powerful. As recounted by Shiro Hagiwara (a general manager at Sega's hardware division) and Ian Oliver (the managing director of Sega subsidiary Cross Products), the SH-4 was chosen while it was still in development and following a lengthy deliberation process because it was the only available processor that "could adapt to deliver the 3D geometry calculation performance necessary". By February 1998, Sega had renamed the Dural "Katana" (after the Japanese sword), although certain hardware specifications such as random access memory (RAM) were not yet finalized (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast).

Elite Avant Garde (model 6081, French), Fidelity Electronics, 1986

In late 1985 / early 1986, Fidelity launched the avant-garde successor to the Fidelity Elite A / S. Visually, the devices are similar, but buttons and display have been brought from the front (Elite A / S) to the right and added to a second display. The program was the so-called "Elite XC", which won the open American computer championship in Mobile (Alabama) in 1985. Therefore, the device was also named "Mobile Master (6081)". On the 8bit base of the 6502 processor, the 1986 Fidelity Elite Avantgarde 2100 (6088) followed, which included a slightly redesigned par excellence program with a larger reopening library (28,000 half leads) (source, translated from German: https://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php?title=Fidelity_Elite_Avantgarde).

Game Boy Light, Nintendo, 1997

The Game Boy Light was released on April 14, 1998 for ¥6,800 and was only available in Japan. Considered the rarest of rare Game Boys, NIB Game Boy Light units regularly sell in the triple-figures on online auction websites. The Game Boy Light is only slightly bigger than the Game Boy Pocket and features an Electroluminescent backlight for low-light  conditions. It uses 2 AA batteries, which gave it approximately 20 hours with the light off and 12 with it on. It was available in two standard colors; Gold and Silver, as well as numerous special editions. There is an Astro Boy edition with a clear case with an Astro Boy picture on it. There is a Osamu Tezuka World shop edition with a clear red case and a picture of his characters. There is a Pokémon Center Tokyo version in yellow color. There is a clear 'skeleton' Famitsu edition which had only 5,000 units released. There is a clear yellow edition separate from the solid yellow Pokémon Center Tokyo version (source: http://www.thefullwiki.org/Game_Boy_Light).

PS/1 (Spanish), International Business Machines, 1989

The IBM PS/1 was a brand for a line of personal computers and was IBM's return to the home market in 1990, five years after the IBM PCjr. It was replaced by the IBM Aptiva in September 1994. The PS/1 line was discontinued in 1994 and replaced with the Aptiva line, which was architecturally very similar to the later models of the PS/1, but with a more marketing-friendly name. Aptivas were sold in the United States until early 2000, when price pressures made the line unprofitable and IBM withdrew from the retail desktop PC market entirely (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/1).

M1, Korg, 1988

The Korg M1 is the world's first widely known music workstation. Its onboard MIDI sequencer and palette of sounds allowed musicians to produce complete professional arrangements. Outselling the Yamaha DX7 and Roland D-50, the M1 became the top-selling digital synthesizer of its time. Rackmount versions of the M1 were available. The M1R was a 2U rack with the same ROM and patches and combis as the M1. The M1EX keyboard and M1R-EX (rack version) included an additional 4MB block of waveforms in ROM. The M3R was a cut-down model in 1U form factor that had similar sounds and its own line of ROM cards. The M1's synth engine remained nearly unchanged until the Korg Trinity's breakthrough in 1995, with minor improvements concerning polyphony, more control sources, and more effects algorithms. The T series (1989: T1/T2/T3) built upon the M1's success, offering more keyboard alternatives (88, 76 and 61-key versions), a disk drive and more ROM samples, more sequencer capacity, and a better screen. However, the polyphony stalled at 16 notes and the effects blocks were untouched. A 1 MB sample RAM option allowed users to load a handful of samples for use with the synth sections. The T1 series is able to read memory cards (RAM and ROM) that work in the M1, and can also load M1 patches and Combi's from SysEx files (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_M1).

Mephisto MM V (V5.0), Hegener & Glaser, 1990

Mephisto MM V program appeared on the market and is still one of the most popular modules! This has several reasons: First, it is the last module of Hegener and Glaser, which can also be operated in Mephisto Mobil and thus "pocket-portable" is. Second, it is up to his playing style. But the program itself has other undeniable qualities: the narrow opening repertoire has failed, for which a scope is specified of 8000 half moves. But at least all transpositions are detected. To compensate, you can pick up the HG 550 Opening module that expands the scope to about 20,000 half-moves, but in the mobile / slot can not be operated (source, traslated from german: http://www.schach-computer.info/wiki/index.php/Mephisto_MM_V).

The Grundy NewBrain was a microcomputer sold in the early 1980s by Grundy Business Systems Ltd of Teddington and Cambridge, England. The model 'AD' also included a one-line, 16-character, vacuum fluorescent (VF) display on the unit which permitted operation with or without a TV screen or monitor - the VF display responded to the cursor keys and scrolled around the screen display area. One additional model was released, but this was a custom version for a pharmaceutical chain, with no screen display - only the VF display - and was never generally discussed (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundy_NewBrain).

Select-A-Game: Baseball 4, Entex, 1981

The Entex Select-a-game is a handheld game system released in 1981 by Entex Industries. Entex released six games for the system before they dropped support in 1982 in favor of the Entex Adventure Vision. The Select-a-Game used a 7 x 16 vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) array of large dots as the main display. It could display two colors, red and blue. These were combined with static overlays for each game. Together they made the display. The system was basically a display and controller for the games with no built-in processor power. Each game cartridge contained a microprocessor programmed with the appropriate game code in it. In this respect, it was very similar to the concept of Milton Bradley's Microvision system released a few years earlier. The system could be powered by 4 C batteries, or by an external A/C power supply. The power supply was only available by mail-order, and as such is exceptionally hard to find today (but a common universal A/C adapter will work with the system). The games released for the system were: Space Invaders 2, Basketball 3, Football 4, Pinball, Baseball 4, Pac-Man 2, Battleship (not released) and Turtles (not released). Space Invaders 2 came with the system. In late 1981, Entex was sued by Coleco, which held the licensing rights to handheld versions of Pac-Man at the time, for copyright infringement over their upcoming release of Pac-Man 2. The game was pulled shortly after release as part of the settlement. Because of this, Pac-Man 2 is the rarest game released for the system. The game cartridges play very similar to their hand held counterparts (Entex made quite a few hand held games such as Space Invaders 2, Basketball 3, Pac-Man 2, etc.). (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entex_Select-A-Game).

In late 1981, Entex was sued by Coleco, which held the licensing rights to handheld versions of Pac-Man at the time, for copyright infringement over their upcoming release of Pac-Man 2. The game was pulled shortly after release as part of the settlement. Because of this, Pac-Man 2 is the rarest game released for the system. The game cartridges play very similar to their hand held counterparts (Entex made quite a few hand held games such as Space Invaders 2, Basketball 3, Pac-Man 2, etc.). (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entex_Select-A-Game).

Select-A-Game: Space Invader 2, Entex, 1981

The Entex Select-a-game is a handheld game system released in 1981 by Entex Industries. Entex released six games for the system before they dropped support in 1982 in favor of the Entex Adventure Vision. The Select-a-Game used a 7 x 16 vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) array of large dots as the main display. It could display two colors, red and blue. These were combined with static overlays for each game. Together they made the display. The system was basically a display and controller for the games with no built-in processor power. Each game cartridge contained a microprocessor programmed with the appropriate game code in it. In this respect, it was very similar to the concept of Milton Bradley's Microvision system released a few years earlier. The system could be powered by 4 C batteries, or by an external A/C power supply. The power supply was only available by mail-order, and as such is exceptionally hard to find today (but a common universal A/C adapter will work with the system). The games released for the system were: Space Invaders 2, Basketball 3, Football 4, Pinball, Baseball 4, Pac-Man 2, Battleship (not released) and Turtles (not released). Space Invaders 2 came with the system. In late 1981, Entex was sued by Coleco, which held the licensing rights to handheld versions of Pac-Man at the time, for copyright infringement over their upcoming release of Pac-Man 2. The game was pulled shortly after release as part of the settlement. Because of this, Pac-Man 2 is the rarest game released for the system. The game cartridges play very similar to their hand held counterparts (Entex made quite a few hand held games such as Space Invaders 2, Basketball 3, Pac-Man 2, etc.).

SVI-328 (NTSC) + SVI-806 80 column card, Spectravideo, 1983

The Spectravideo SV-328 was the prototype for the MSX design.  But there were some small differences, making the 318/328 incompatible with MSX. Some of the differences where the BIOS, I/O ports and disk format.  But this didn't stop Spectravideo from using the MSX story in their marketing of the 318/328. Some of the marketing material for the SV-318/328 is more or less telling that the computers will run MSX software (source: http://www.samdal.com/svhistory.htm).

SVI-603 Coleco Game Adapter, Spectravideo, 1983

We admit that Colecovision with its many advanced features provides some of the most thrilling, realistic video game action in the world.  But why buy a Colecovision machine that only lets you play video games when, for just a little more money, you can play all the great games from Coleco and have you very own computer? It sounds too good to be true, but Spectavideo's unique Colecovison Game Adapter makes it possible. This adapter easily hooks up to the SV-318 og SV-329 (source: http://www.samdal.com/svperipherals.htm).

In August of 1983 TI released the TI-99/4A QI. Though this name was not official for the console, it was what the motherboard was designated. QI stood for Quality Improved. No visual changes were made to the exterior of the console, and in fact they are very hard to distinguish from the beige models. On the other hand, major changes were made to the internal components of the QI. We will take a look at these changes a little later (source: http://www.mainbyte.com/ti99/computers/ti99qi.html).

It has a very robotic voice. You can turn the voice off. Level 1 is for beginners and levels 6 and 7 are for tournament, being 6 for practice and 7 for tournament teacher. There is a test program that can be used for diagnostics and to confirm the machine is working fine. This is one example where we can see the many "names" for Fidelity.

V.Smile (France), V-Tech, 2005

The V.Smile is an educational game system by VTech. It is designed for children ages 3 to 6, but offers software designed for several age groups between 3-9. Titles are available on ROM cartridges called 'Smartridges', to play off the system's educational nature. The graphics are primarily sprite-based. The console is often sold bundled with a particular game. Several variants of the V.Smile console are sold including handheld versions, or models with added functionality such as touch tablet integrated controllers or microphones. The V-Motion is a major variant with its own software lineup that includes motion sensitive controllers and has Smartriges designed to take advantage of motion-related "active learning". The V-Motion and Smartriges however are fully backwards compatible with other V.Smile variants and V.Smile Smartridges, and a V-Motion Smartrige can even be played on V.Smile console or handheld, albeit with limited functionality (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.Smile).

- 27/10/2012 r18736: Deleted: a3000.c. More Amiga movement + fixes by David haywood [Miodrag Milanovic].
- 0.141u3: Changed cubocd32.c to cd32.c driver, machine\cubocd32.c to machine\cd32.c and includes\cubocd32.h to includes\cd32.h. Amiga fixes [Roberto Zandona]: Removed additional 2 cycles, in move operation, for non-Agnus registers. Set to #0 the start cycle in the copper operation. David Haywood refactored the CD32 code base to eliminate duplicate code between MAME and MESS. Atari Ace cleaned up a few include files in CD32 driver.
- 0.140u2: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed problems with i2cmem. Cubo CD32 games now save and load settings properly.
- 0.140u1: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed crash in machine\cubocd32.c (akiko_frame_proc).
- 0.139u4: Atari Ace converted Amiga drivers to use driver_devices. Merged common code between legacy Amiga and AGA video systems.
- 0.138u4: Removed machine\i2cmemdev.c/h. smf turned i2cmem into a C++ device & ditched the unused legacy device.
- 0.136u2: Curt Coder refactored the CIA 6526 interface, adding SP/CNT callbacks. Fixed serial transfer.
- 0.135u4: Curt Coder fixed CIA6526 FLAG handling and slight interface cleanup.
- 0.134: Robiza fixed 6526 CIA PRA, PRB, DDRA and DDRB ports and added partial fix to 6526 CIA timer: Avoid timer's desync in read count operation.
- 0.133u5: Robiza added different TOD implementation for CIA6526 and CIA8520.
- 0.132u4: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed Cubo CD32 framerate to 50Hz. Better fix for Amiga AGA ddf_stop_pixel, to avoid breaking Amiga 1200 startup screen.
- 0.132u3: Mariusz Wojcieszek fixed AGA display window start and stop (fixes startup screen and lsrquiz & lsrquiz2 missing graphics). Changed visible area to 703x272. Added dipswitches 'DSW1 6' and 'DSW2 1->8'.
- 0.132u2: Cubo CD32 update [Stephane Humbert]: Fixed inputs and found why inputs are not read (protection ?), hacked to work now. Amiga AGA update [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: Fixed sprite data fetching and sprite colors.
- 0.130u3: Added machine\i2cmemdev.c/h. Samuele Zannoli added device-based implementations of the EEPROM and I2C devices.
- 0.130u2: Added video\amigaaga.c. WIP driver for Cubo CD32 [Mariusz Wojcieszek]: AGA palette. AGA bitplane data fetching. support for up to 8 standard bitplanes. HAM8 mode.
- 0.129u5: Dirk Best added support for the /PC output pin to the CIA emulation.
- 0.129u4: Nathan Woods changed 6526cia to use devcb.
- 0.129u1: Nathan Woods added a validity check to the 6526 CIA emulation.
- 0.128u7: Nathan Woods added running_machine callbacks for the Amiga code.
- 0.128u5: Made the 6526/8520 CIA implementations be devices [Nathan Woods]: Added differentiation between the r1 and r2 versions of the 6526; not acting on it yet.
- 0.125u1: Robiza added feature to the cia6526: In READ operation the value can be forced by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS.
- 0.123u4: Zsolt Vasvari converted Amiga based games to partial updating and proper scanline based timers.
- 0.122u4: Updated Amiga driver to use formal XTALs [Dirk Best].
- 0.121u1: Nathan Woods added an API to access the current amiga_machine_interface.
- 0.120u2: Added machine\i2cmem.c. smf added generic I2C bus memory support. Hooked up to the cubocd32 driver.
- 0.118u5: Added machine\cubocd32.c and includes\cubocd32.h. CuboCD32/Amiga updates [Ernesto Corvi]: Finished implementing the CDROM controller, so now the games boot. Moved the entire Akiko code to machine/cubocd32.c to make things a little more easier to work with. Added CDDA audio support to the CDROM controller and driver. Systems with the AGA chipset no longer connect bit 0 of the CIA that was previously connected to the Overlay pin not connected. Made BLTDDAT return it's value. This is a readable register which we were not handling. Initialized the SERDATR register upon reset to reflect that the transfer buffer/shift reg is empty. Changed 68EC020 CPU1 clock speed to 14187580 Hz and visible area to 671x272. Added CD/DA sound and dipswitches 'Service Mode' and 'DSW1 2-8'.
- 0.118u4: Amiga updates [Erneso Corvi]: Implemented ECS-Only BLTCON0L register. Modified the amiga_interface structure to add a nmi callback and a flags variable. Added AGA chipmem mask definition. Added 32 bit data bus support to chipram. It's automatically used if the chipset is AGA. Added clock chip constants in machine/amiga.h for 68k PAL and NTSC, and 68EC00 NTSC. Updates drivers to use those constants. Added convenience macros to determine wether we're running with an ECS chipset, AGA chipset, or 'ECS or AGA chipset'. Changed autoconfig reads to return 0x0000 instead of 0xffff. Fixed MSB value timer reads on the 8520 cia. We were previously only updating the count for the timer when the LSB value was read. Added basic Akiko emulation to the cubocd32 driver. Both the Chunky to Planar converter, and the I2C NVRAM should be fully implemented, however, the CDROM functionality is not complete. It's only enough to make the kickstart pass the Akiko checks. Changed 68EC020 CPU1 clock speed to 14318180 Hz. Added Custom (3579545 Hz) sound and 'DSW1 1' dipswitch.
- 0.118u3: Amiga system updates [Ernesto Corvi]: Implemented the ECS-only BLTSIZV and BLTSIZH custom registers, and modified BLTSIZE and the blitter to use them. Properly implemented the bit in VPOSR that indicates if we're running on a PAL or NTSC Amiga.
- 0.117: Peter Rittwage reverted patch to the 6526CIA as it was causing issues with Amiga/Arcadia emulation.
- 0.115u3: Peter Rittwage fixed bit calculation in 6526cia.c which broke joysticks in the MESS C64 driver.
- 0.113u2: Changed VSync to 59.997000 Hz.
